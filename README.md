# proto
BH Coding Excercise 3s

Assumptions:
- Only need to list future schedule emails dates

ToDo, this is just a prototype, a real proyect should:
- Make calls to a RESTful API instead of using browser storage
- Web service should use a DB
- There was no clean up/refactor, as the time-boxed was set to 90 minutes
- The UI is not friendly when you add/remove it does not let you know if any issue in the front-end
